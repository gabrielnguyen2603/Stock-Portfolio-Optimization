# Stock Portfolio Optimization 

## Goal 
This project aims to build a Python-based portfolio optimization tool that uses historical stock data to estimate returns and risks, apply optimization techniques (e.g., Mean-Variance, Risk Parity, Mean-CVaR), and construct efficient portfolios. The optimized portfolios are then backtested and compared against benchmarks, with results visualized through efficient frontier plots, allocation charts, and performance metrics.
